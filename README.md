# 	Generating Synthetic Data for OCR Applications

The goal of this library is to be a semi-flexible, dataset generator for 2d OCR applications. You can generate thousands of images (if not millions) to train your model, then fine-tune the model on domain specific real world datasets.

Online, there are [thousands of fonts](https://www.extensis.com/blog/how-many-fonts-are-there-in-the-world), all with wildly different glyphs for hundreds of languages, this library takes in fonts and a config to generate a large amount of 'unique' data. The config allows you to change dozens of parameters, to generate data approximate to your use case. 

## Use Cases

- Datasets for 'standard' OCR pipelines
- Datasets for [text style transfer](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Wang_Typography_With_Decor_Intelligent_Text_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf)
- Datasets for text inpainting
